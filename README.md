# Raytracing Python
This repository is a copy of a little project that i had to do at university.

The code is in French because I hadn't hee choice.

Please, keep in mind: this code is a study work, and it wasn't made to be share on GitHub.
Its only one objectif was and is to see how works the raytracing with a simple code.

We had to work on recursive functions. I know they make my script slower.
